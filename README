1. Overview
===============================================================================
This is a collection of tests written over uverbs intended for use as a
performance micro-benchmark. As an example, the tests can be used for
HW or SW tuning and/or functional testing.

The collection conatains a set of BW and latency benchmark such as :

	* Read   - ib_read_bw and ib_read_lat.
	* Write  - ib_write_bw and ib_wriet_lat.
	* Send   - ib_send_bw and ib_send_lat.
	* Atomic - ib_atomic_bw and ib_atomic_lat
	* In additional :  ib_write_bw_postlist and ib_clock_test.

Please post results/observations to the openib-general mailing list.
See "Contact Us" at http://openib.org/mailman/listinfo/openib-general and

===============================================================================
2. Notes on Testing Methodology
===============================================================================
- The benchmark used the CPU cycle counter to get time stamps without context
  switch.  Some CPU architectures (e.g., Intel's 80486 or older PPC) do NOT
  have such capability.

- The benchmark measures round-trip time but reports half of that as one-way
  latency. This means that it may not be sufficiently accurate for asymmetrical
  configurations.

- On Bw benchmarks , We calculate the BW on send side only, as he calculates
  the Bw after collecting completion from the receive side.
  In case we use the bidirectional flag , BW is calculated on both sides 

- Min/Median/Max result is reported.
  The median (vs average) is less sensitive to extreme scores.
  Typically, the "Max" value is the first value measured.

- Larger samples help marginally only. The default (1000) is pretty good.
  Note that an array of cycles_t (typically unsigned long) is allocated
  once to collect samples and again to store the difference between them.
  Really big sample sizes (e.g., 1 million) might expose other problems
  with the program.

- The "-H" option will dump the histogram for additional statistical analysis.
  See xgraph, ygraph, r-base (http://www.r-project.org/), pspp, or other 
  statistical math programs.

Architectures tested:	i686, x86_64, ia64

4. Test Descriptions
===============================================================================

The following tests are mainly useful for HW/SW benchmarking.
They are not intended as actual usage examples.

send_lat.c 	latency test with send transactions
send_bw.c 	BW test with send transactions
write_lat.c 	latency test with RDMA write transactions
write_bw.c 	BW test with RDMA write transactions
read_lat.c 	latency test with RDMA read transactions
read_bw.c 	BW test with RDMA read transactions
atomic_lat.c	latency test with atomic transactions
atomic_bw.c 	BW test atomic transactions

The executable name of each test starts with the general prefix "ib_",
e.g., ib_write_lat.

Running Tests
-------------

Prerequisites: 
	kernel 2.6
	(kernel module) matches libibverbs
	(kernel module) matches librdmacm
	(kernel module) matches libibumad
	(kernel module) matches libmath (lm).
	

Server:		./<test name> <options>
Client:		./<test name> <options> <server IP address>

		o  <server address> is IPv4 or IPv6 address. You can use the IPoIB
                   address if IPoIB is configured.
		o  --help lists the available <options>

  *** IMPORTANT NOTE: The SAME OPTIONS must be passed to both server and client.
  *** IMPORTANT NOTE: You need to be running a Subnet Manager on the switch or on one of the nodes in your fabric, in case you are in IB fabric.

Common Options to all tests:

  -Q, --cq-mod  		Generate Cqe only after <cq-mod> completion

  *** IMPORTANT NOTE: You need to be running a Subnet Manager on the switch or
		      on one of the nodes in your fabric.

Special feature in tests:
-------------------------

  1. RDMA_CM feature.
     You can add to all tests the "-R" flag to connect the QPs from each side with the rdma_cm library.
     In this case, the library will connect the QPs and will use the IPoIB interface for doing it.
     It helps when you don't have Ethernet connection between the 2 nodes.
     You must supply the IPoIB interface as the server IP. 

  2. Multicast feauture in ib_send_lat and in ib_send_bw.
    Send tests have built in feature of testing multicast performance, in verbs level.
    You can use "-g" to specify the number of QPs to attach to this multicast group.
    "-M" flag allows you to choose the multicast group address.


===============================================================================
5. Known Issues
===============================================================================
Up until now, we still have known (unsolved) issues in the package.
Here is a list of the main issues:

 1. Multicast feauture in ib_send_lat and in ib_send_bw still have many problems!
    Will increase the support and bug fixes in this Q, but now the tests may stuck
    and could produce undefine behaviours.

 2. Bidirectional feature in ib_send_bw test, when running in UD or UC mode.
    The algorithm we use for the bidirectional measurement is designed for RC connection type.
    When running in UC or UD connection types, there is a small probablity the test will be stuck.
    We are working now to fix it.

 3. RDMA_CM feature in read tests still doesn't work.
